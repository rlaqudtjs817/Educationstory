<p>do you think the education system of Germany is enough to make smart students? and if you are Korean, what have you think Korea education system? <br>
I want to change Korea education system for a future generation. and I need more people for my plan.</p>

<p>first off, I decided to research german education. because I think german education is a revolution for me. no exam, a lot of ways to learn, even Low or No Tuition Fees.</p>

<p>my opinion is  Korea education system is worst for a student, for future generations. as you know already, Korea students study mornings tonight without a goal. <br>my high school student life was boring and confused.
I thought about my self like this. why  I study hard? for what?, when I was a high school student. </p>

<p class="mb-5">so I want Korea education system is changing in the future. and I want Korea education value is changing soon.</p>
