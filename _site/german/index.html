          <p>why the education system of Germany is strong?</p>

<p>I think one of the reasons is the German government policy is changed after WW2. I decided to do research on education for me and record on my Blog. Let’s see first what is the education system of Germany.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.studying-in-germany.org/german-education-system/#qualifications-of-the-german-higher-education-system">참고link</a></p>

<h1 id="this-is-how-the-german-school-system-works">This is how the German school system works</h1>

<p>The ministry closely collaborates with Federation and Landers (German states), educational institutions, organizations for supervising the entire activity.</p>

<p>Landers and the Federation (which has a minor role), they have a responsibility for education issues in Germany.</p>

<p>Though, there are areas of cooperation in the education field for which such a distinction between both parts doesn’t exist. this is a school system structured in Germany.</p>

<h2 id="compulsory-education-in-germany">Compulsory Education in Germany</h2>

<p>What Is Considered as Compulsory Education in Germany?</p>

<p>All Germans have to accept primary and secondary education. it is a duty for all German education.</p>

<p>ever since child reach the age of 6, up until they complete 9-year full-time schooling at Gymnasium, or 10 years of full-time years for other general education schools.</p>

<p>If you are youngsters fail to attend full-time classes at the general or vocational education schools, at upper secondary level, they’ve to attend part-time left-aside classes.</p>

<p>This applies even if they’ve already passed the period of their compulsory education.</p>

<p>Such an obligation is “Berufsschule Berufsschulpflicht” and lasts 3 years.</p>

<p>if your children who fail to attend at all such education and training, they’ve may be required to attend full-time classes and training (for vocational schools only).</p>

<p>this is important to Disabled youngsters.</p>

<p>Disabled youngsters have an obligation to complete compulsory education too.</p>

<p>they have to attend either a normal school or a special school.
“Sonderpadagogische Bildungseinrichtungen”.</p>

<p>one more thing.</p>

<p>German compulsory education is included a participate in school lessons, as well as in other formal and informal schooling activities/events/projects.</p>

<p>So, parents need to supervise study progress children for them and participate in school parent’s meetings.</p>

<h3 id="german-tertiary-education">German Tertiary Education</h3>

<p>German tertiary education in Germany provides higher education for qualifying individuals, who before all, have completed secondary education in Germany or abroad which entitles them to enter higher education studies.</p>

<p>** <strong>Who’s Responsible for Supervision of German Tertiary Education?</strong></p>

<p>German Tertiary Education is following Higher education Basic law. independently about managing the scholarship awarding, research and teaching activity in institutions.</p>

<p>so German Tertiary Education is helpful to a student. even they can study more if they want to do that.</p>

<p>Let’s see Institutions of German Tertiary Education. As you can found they have a lot of Institutions.</p>

<p>·    Universities “<em>Universit<strong>ä</strong>ten”</em> <em>and Equal Institutions**.</em></p>

<p>·    “Technische Hochschulen”/”Technische Universitäten”.</p>

<p>·    “Pädagogische Hochschulen”.</p>

<p>·    Theological colleges.</p>

<p>·    Universities of Applied Sciences <em>“<strong>Fachhochschulen</strong>”.</em></p>

<p>·    Art and Music Colleges.</p>

<p>·    Higher Education Institutions for Federal Armed Forces.</p>

<p>·    Higher Education Institutions Offering Dual Studies <em>“**Berufsakademie”</em> <em>(BA).</em></p>

<p>·    Institutions of Continuing Vocational Education <em>“<strong>Fachschulen</strong>”</em> And <em>“**Fachakademien”</em> In Berlin.</p>

<p><em>A</em>ccording to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), the education received from these institutions is equal to the first level of higher education.</p>

<p>even they can study more if they want to do that. German universities have a lot of study courses. this is Qualifications of the German Higher Education System. You can found 3 differently way higher Education System.</p>

<p><strong>Bachelor</strong> <strong>Degree – First German Higher Education Qualification</strong></p>

<p>The first higher education qualification in Germany is the Bachelor degree. The standard period of study “<em>Regelstudienzeit</em>” in a Bachelor program is 6 semesters, or 3 full academic years.  In Universities of Applied Sciences bachelor studies last 6-7 semesters, by also including the practical work. In German Colleges of Art and Music such studies last about 8 semesters or 4 academic years. In Professional Academies they last 3 academic years. In Fachschulen bachelor degree studies last 2 academic years.</p>

<p><strong>Magister Degree – Second German Higher Education Qualification.</strong></p>

<p>The second higher education qualification in Germany is the Master degree. It takes 2 -4 semesters to complete studies in a German master degree program. In universities and equal institutions as well as college of art and music, this period is mostly 4 semesters. In Fachhochschulen this period is 3-4 semesters.</p>

<p>To complete a Master degree, students must achieve 300 ECTS credit points also including the points received by the earlier qualification. To complete a Master degree, a student whose earlier qualification is a Bachelor degree, must achieve 360 ECTS points.</p>

<p>) <strong>PhD</strong> <strong>Degree –</strong> <strong>third</strong> <strong>German Higher Education Qualification.</strong></p>

<p>The third higher education qualification in Germany is the PHD degree. This is a program that is embraced by the most qualified students, and can be taken at German universities and equivalent institutions, in collaboration with non-university research institutes.</p>

<p>There is no standardized period for completing doctoral studies, as this is a more in-depth and individual specialization.</p>

<p>And the German Higher Education System has an exam for entrance university or college for study. but almost a student doesn’t pay the school fee. because of German government support to students.</p>

<p>we can figure out together, the secret of the German education, and more history about education. we will talk on next post about, why the education system of Germany is strong, and weakness.</p>
