# This is how the German school system works



The ministry closely collaborates with Federation and Landers (German states), educational institutions, organizations for supervising the entire activity.



 Landers and the Federation (which has a minor role), they have a responsibility for education issues in Germany.

### German Tertiary Education

German tertiary education in Germany provides higher education for qualifying individuals, who before all, have completed secondary education in Germany or abroad which entitles them to enter higher education studies.



** **Who’s Responsible for Supervision of German Tertiary Education?**

German Tertiary Education is following Higher education Basic law. independently about managing the scholarship awarding, research and teaching activity in institutions.



so German Tertiary Education is helpful to a student. even they can study more if they want to do that.



Let's see Institutions of German Tertiary Education. As you can found they have a lot of Institutions.

·    Universities “*Universit**ä**ten”* *and Equal Institutions**.*

·    “Technische Hochschulen”/”Technische Universitäten”.

·    “Pädagogische Hochschulen”.

·    Theological colleges.

·    Universities of Applied Sciences *“**Fachhochschulen**”.*

·    Art and Music Colleges.

·    Higher Education Institutions for Federal Armed Forces.

·    Higher Education Institutions Offering Dual Studies *“**Berufsakademie”* *(BA).*

·    Institutions of Continuing Vocational Education *“**Fachschulen**”* And *“**Fachakademien”* In Berlin.

*A*ccording to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), the education received from these institutions is equal to the first level of higher education.



even they can study more if they want to do that. German universities have a lot of study courses. this is Qualifications of the German Higher Education System. You can found 3 differently way higher Education System.



**Bachelor** **Degree – First German Higher Education Qualification**

The first higher education qualification in Germany is the Bachelor degree. The standard period of study “*Regelstudienzeit*” in a Bachelor program is 6 semesters, or 3 full academic years.  In Universities of Applied Sciences bachelor studies last 6-7 semesters, by also including the practical work. In German Colleges of Art and Music such studies last about 8 semesters or 4 academic years. In Professional Academies they last 3 academic years. In Fachschulen bachelor degree studies last 2 academic years.

To complete a Master degree, students must achieve 300 ECTS credit points also including the points received by the earlier qualification. To complete a Master degree, a student whose earlier qualification is a Bachelor degree, must achieve 360 ECTS points.



) **PhD** **Degree –** **third** **German Higher Education Qualification.**

The third higher education qualification in Germany is the PHD degree. This is a program that is embraced by the most qualified students, and can be taken at German universities and equivalent institutions, in collaboration with non-university research institutes.

There is no standardized period for completing doctoral studies, as this is a more in-depth and individual specialization.

And the German Higher Education System has an exam for entrance university or college for study. but almost a student doesn't pay the school fee. because of German government support to students.



we can figure out together, the secret of the German education, and more history about education. we will talk on next post about, why the education system of Germany is strong, and weakness.
