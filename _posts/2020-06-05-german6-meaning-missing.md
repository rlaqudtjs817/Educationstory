Let's talk about education and what you have experience in your life. do you think school is important for children? if your answer is yes, let me know.



back to write. to be honest, my opinion is education is important. some students learn new knowledge form education, some students learn a new skill to live world. and students learn to live together in the future at the school, without racism.



to me, school meaning is camp to live together with another person. to me, school meaning is to learn how can make relationships with another person. But I think almost Korea student learn competition at school first. and then they learn a lot of subject for the test.



I was growing up in Korea until now. of course, I was thinking about what I learned at school past, until after Australia working holiday.



 I found this reason. I learned the only subject for the College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) without discussion. there is no discussion, there is no critical education.



I remember my high school life. studied hard no reason. even class friends studied the same as me. I thought this is terrible for the future, and I thought about my life. "why I study hard every day?" "do I have to stay at school morning- night?"I couldn't learn how can I found an answer about some question by 19 years my self.

It's my personal life experience, but it's my one of opinions this is a problem of Korea education system.



Korea education is the education of competition. we need to realise this is one of the biggest problems for future generations as soon as possible.



**It's  Korea school building.**

**and you can see how they study hard all day.**

**I heard about Finland, german, or another country education system.**
some countries student studies only less 6 class a day. and german student study without a test.

**I started to research the England education system for figures out what is the biggest difference. England education system is different compare Korea education system.**

The UK offers specialized training based on student abilities.

Also, according to the majors the student wants to study, the required subjects are selectively selected to study and the grades of the subjects studied when going to college are reflected.

From childhood, students in England experience essay-oriented problems to improve their comprehension, thinking, and logic.

All tests in the UK, for example, GCSE, A-Level, Foundation, are all questions (subjective)

Advanced sports such as rugby, fencing, cricket, horseback riding, rowing, ballet, and essential subjects such as musical instrument lessons, arts, and plays are enjoyed on-campus as performances and related training.

When you look at English students, you will be required to learn 10 subjects from elementary school (private school only), including English, mathematics, science, geography, history, sociology, politics, art, computers, and design technology.

The reason for studying these subjects is because they learn about the related fields of each major and the causality of how it is applied and reflected in reality.

British schools are largely divided into short breaks of about a week in the semester (Summer Break) from mid-June to the beginning of the new school year from the beginning of the new school year.

There are about one week in mid-February, three weeks in early April (Easter), one week in late May, seven to eight weeks in summer vacation, and one week in mid-October or late.[1](https://post.naver.com/viewer/postView.nhn?volumeNo=16316616&memberNo=36835023)

In addition, during this period, the school mainly conducts research or project tasks, and conducts consistent education so that students can study for themselves, reach conclusions through data research and research, and improve problem solving skills.

Through a special curriculum, students can find ways to study difficult subjects themselves. Making it easy to get to the subject is a characteristic of British education.

**Let's think about next question.**

### do you think Korea student missing important things?

My opinion is Korea student is can't learn to find a way to answer study, use research at school if the Korea education system is never changing to a better solution.

recently, the situation is changing now. but it is not enough for a change better way of future generations.



for example England case and Korea case, From the difference between the curriculum and the class you can found this fact.



**Let's see Korea case first.**



1. **Basic academic knowledge and importance of compulsory subjects continue to be emphasized from elementary to law school.**

2. **Subjects of special importance are subjects other than Korean, English, Mathematics, and Science, and focus on education in one direction.**



3. **Continually learning English and second foreign languages.**

However, in the case of the second foreign language, it is for college entrance exams.



Korea students a study only grammar a lot, and they are remembering hard English word for college entrance exams.

4. **Teacher's moving class. (except for certain subjects, students do not move) **



I already graduated from high school  in 2007. but I remember I was moving to the classroom to classroom for only Japanese class.



5. **Extensive curriculum irrelevant to college and future hopes.**



**but England case is different.**



1. **The content of the lessons varies significantly depending on the learning method of the lower and upper grades.**



2. **Teaching students to be interested and have fun in some of the less'academic' areas, such as mental health, hobbies and skills.**



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DD9LK3vNWiU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

3. **aims to cultivate language proficiency so that students can learn and practice step by step, systematically from low grade.**



4. **Students move from classroom to classroom-more specialized and systematic lessons, taking responsibility for class preparation.**



5. **3-4 specialized subject learning related to majors and professions.**



As you can see, the education system is totally different.

so we need an education revolution, no more don't need to change a little part.



we need no more competition, no more Education that hurts self-esteem.

this slogan is important for future generations.



**"school is a place to learn to live together basically"**
